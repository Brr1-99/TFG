 My Project for University

 This project consists in creating an API in order to manage all the products from the different workshops of the Uvigo.
They should be located in a database and you can do requests via web in order to get information about those products.
Operations are located in the next list:
 - Search for products
 - Add new products
 - Update / delete a existing product
 - Transfer products between workshops
 - Additional features (still working on)

If you would like to try this repository, you need to install the Xampp aplication in order to have your own database.
It is managed via phpmyadmin and the code of the app normally used is php. In this case, I rather used python's module Flask because I'm more fluent with it.
Hope you enjoy it.
